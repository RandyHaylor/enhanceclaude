  "overview": "This skill generates .d2 diagram files for use with the D2 VS Code extension. It includes templates for common diagram types (flowcharts, architecture, sequence, state machine, SQL schema, class diagrams, cloud infrastructure, and grid dashboards), a comprehensive syntax quick-reference, and advanced features like layers, scenarios, themes, and imports. The skill follows a guided workflow to help users select the right template and produce validated, renderable diagrams.",
