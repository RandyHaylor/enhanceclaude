## Overview
This skill applies typographic hierarchy principles to structure text so that headers tell the complete story on their own. Content is organized for three reading depths: glancers understand the concept from top-level headers, skimmers get key takeaways from mid-level headers, and readers access full supporting details. The approach works across technical docs, marketing copy, research notes, and any medium that benefits from clear visual information hierarchy.

## Try These Prompts
- Reformat this README using typographic hierarchy so it's scannable at glance, skim, and read depths.
- Structure this research summary so headers tell the full story without requiring anyone to read the body text.
- Apply typographic hierarchy to this technical spec — keep it professional but make it skimmable.
- I have a long list of equally-weighted bullet points. Help me group and restructure them with proper header hierarchy.

## Use Cases
- README and documentation formatting
- Technical specification writing
- Marketing copy structure
- Research note organization
- Slide deck and report outlining
