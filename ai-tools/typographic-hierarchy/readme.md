## Overview
This skill applies typographic hierarchy principles to structure text so that headers tell the complete story on their own. Content is organized for three reading depths: glancers understand the concept from top-level headers, skimmers get key takeaways from mid-level headers, and readers access full supporting details. The approach works across technical docs, marketing copy, research notes, and any medium that benefits from clear visual information hierarchy.
