  "overview": "This skill applies typographic hierarchy principles to structure text so that headers tell the complete story on their own. Content is organized for three reading depths: glancers understand the concept from top-level headers, skimmers get key takeaways from mid-level headers, and readers access full supporting details. The approach works across technical docs, marketing copy, research notes, and any medium that benefits from clear visual information hierarchy.",
  "promptSuggestions": [
    "Reformat this README using typographic hierarchy so it's scannable at glance, skim, and read depths.",
    "Structure this research summary so headers tell the full story without requiring anyone to read the body text.",
    "Apply typographic hierarchy to this technical spec — keep it professional but make it skimmable.",
    "I have a long list of equally-weighted bullet points. Help me group and restructure them with proper header hierarchy."
