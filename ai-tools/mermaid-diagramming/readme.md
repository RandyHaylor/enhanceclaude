## Overview
This skill provides comprehensive guidance for creating and editing Mermaid diagrams in VS Code using the MermaidChart extension. It covers all essential syntax including node shapes, edge types, subgraph layout rules, styling, and configuration. Notably, it documents the critical subgraph direction behavior where `direction TB` is silently ignored when nodes link across subgraphs, saving you from one of Mermaid's most common pitfalls.

## Installation
Requires VS Code MermaidChart extension for preview.
