## Overview
SOLID Vue Development provides a set of core principles for building maintainable Vue 3 applications. It enforces clear separation between state (what something is) and behavior (what something does), defines strict component boundaries where components call functions rather than owning logic, and promotes the manager pattern for encapsulating domain state and behavior. The skill also covers proper use of reactive chains, explicit naming conventions, and scope discipline to prevent premature abstraction.
