## Overview
SOLID Vue Development provides a set of core principles for building maintainable Vue 3 applications. It enforces clear separation between state and behavior, defines strict component boundaries where components call functions rather than owning logic, and promotes the manager pattern for encapsulating domain state and behavior. The skill also covers proper use of reactive chains, explicit naming conventions, and scope discipline to prevent premature abstraction.

## Try These Prompts
- Review this Vue component and flag any violations of the manager pattern or component boundary rules.
- I have auth logic mixed into my component. Help me refactor it into a proper manager following SOLID Vue principles.
- Is this computed property correct, or am I using it for side effects or process logic that should be a function?
- Review my naming conventions across this composable — are my refs, functions, and CSS variables following the explicit naming rules?

## Use Cases
- Vue 3 architecture review
- Component boundary enforcement
- Manager pattern implementation
- Reactive chain design
- Naming convention auditing
