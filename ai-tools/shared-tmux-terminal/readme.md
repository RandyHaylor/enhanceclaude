## Overview
Shared Tmux Terminal creates a visible tmux session that acts as a collaborative workspace between Claude and the user. Claude can autonomously send commands and read output from the terminal, while the user retains full control to type directly at any time -- including entering sudo passwords or taking over operations. This skill supports session discovery, multi-pane operations, buffer reading, error handling, and persistent session management across platforms.
