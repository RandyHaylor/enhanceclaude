Guide for building fine-grained skills where content is split into many small files to minimize tokens loaded per invocation.

## Tags

## Overview
This skill provides a structured approach to building token-efficient skills using section-based progressive disclosure. Content is broken into small, purpose-specific files that are loaded only when needed, minimizing tokens per invocation. It includes rules for structuring SKILL.md files, section indexes, and content files, along with a methodology for parallelizing skill creation across agent teams.

## Try These Prompts
- Help me restructure my existing skill into a fine-grained format so only the relevant sections are loaded per request.
- I have a large SKILL.md with everything in one file. Walk me through splitting it into section-based files.
- Set up the folder structure for a new fine-grained skill about SQL query optimization.
- I want to build a new skill with an agent team in parallel — guide me through the section planning and agent prompt structure.

## Use Cases
- Reducing token usage for large or complex skills
- Structuring new skills with progressive disclosure
- Refactoring monolithic SKILL.md files into modular formats
- Parallelizing skill creation across agent teams
