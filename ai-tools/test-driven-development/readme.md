## Overview
This skill enforces a strict Red-Green-Next TDD cycle where only one test is written at a time, minimal implementation is added to make it pass, and verification is required before proceeding. It prevents over-implementation by ensuring tests drive all code changes, and includes patterns for mocked timers, async testing, and a systematic procedure for diagnosing test failures through incremental proof tests.

## Installation
