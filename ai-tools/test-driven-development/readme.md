# Test-Driven Development

**Type:** skill | **Version:** 1.0.0 | **OS:** any

Enforce strict Test-Driven Development workflow: write one test, make it pass, verify, then proceed. Prevents over-implementation and ensures code matches requirements exactly.

## Overview
This skill enforces a strict Red-Green-Next TDD cycle where only one test is written at a time, minimal implementation is added to make it pass, and verification is required before proceeding. It prevents over-implementation by ensuring tests drive all code changes, and includes patterns for mocked timers, async testing, and a systematic procedure for diagnosing test failures through incremental proof tests.

## Try These Prompts
- Use TDD to add a user authentication feature — write one test at a time and wait for my confirmation before proceeding.
- A test is failing unexpectedly. Walk me through the proof-test procedure to isolate what's broken.
- Use TDD to add these three config settings: fadeIn, delay, and pause. One test at a time.
- My async test is flaky with fake timers. Help me track cumulative delay time so the assertion is always reliable.

## Use Cases
- Incremental feature implementation
- Preventing scope creep
- Async and timer-based test design
- Test failure diagnosis
- Requirements documentation through tests
